<p> Quotes of poeple who have used RAAPS:
-Since our practice adopted RAAPS, there has been a significant shift… with the knowledge gained through simple, tech savvy screening in a population who notoriously does not talk to adults.” 

DNP, PNP | Federally Qualified Health Center </p>


<p> -“With RAAPS he disclosed that he is a male who has sex with males. We offered STI and HIV testing…because of RAAPS I was able to get him into treatment early.”

<p> -“RAAPS gives providers the ability to discuss sensitive subjects… For many youth, RAAPS gives them the ability to ask for help when they are too afraid to ask out loud.”

FNP | School-Based Health Center</p>
