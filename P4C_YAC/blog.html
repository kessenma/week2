<h2> EXAMPLE BLOG POST:</h1>

<p> Hello perspective <a href="http://www.possibilitiesforchange.com"> Possibilities for Change</a> (P4C) Youth Advisory Council (YAC) member, </p>

<p> Thank you for visiting our blog, we sincerely appreciate you dedicating time to visit. You may be curious what P4C does and how you can help, so heres a quick time line of P4C: </p>

2010:	P4C was founded in 2010 by <a href="https://drjennifersalerno.com"> Dr. Jennifer Salerno</a> after she received her Doctorate in Nurse Practice from the Rush University in Chicago. 

2011:P4C Receives funding from the <a href="https://techtransfer.umich.edu/about/our-history/"> University of Michigan Tech Transfer Venture Accelerator </a>. 

2012:	The <a href="http://www.possibilitiesforchange.com/raaps/">Rapid Assessment for Adolescent Preventive Services© </a> (RAAPS) module is put into use at; the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit serving 9 school and community settings across metro Detroit, and The Michigan Department of Community Health Child and Adolescent Health Center (CAHC), which serves 70+ school-based and school-linked health centers across the state.

2014:	The RAAPS Sexual Health module uncovers keen insights for the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDHC): 
	– 15% of surveyed youth have been homeless in the last 12 months
	– 66% have been suspended
	– 23% report depressive feelings
	– 22% received or sent sexual messages on their phone or the internet
	– 70% have had sex in the past 3 months…
	– …and 40% failed to use a condom the last time they had sex.

2016:	RAAPS 2.0 is finished. The new RAAPS module has tons of features, but the major one is the implementation of the counselor interface with tailored dashboard. This interface provides counselors with a comprehensive view of the risk behaviors of the adolescents’ they see. This is rather ground breaking since it provides counselors targeted statistics to represent their centers population. With the new interface counselors now have one location where they can view and log all relevant risk behavior information for specific clients as well as access evidence-based information and messages customized to suit their clients’ needs.

2017:	Statistics from P4C's RAAPS module are aggregated, published, and released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a CNN article titled <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/14/health/teen-health-risks-cdc-study/index.html"> Fewer teens having sex and using drugs, CDC survey finds </a>

Key findings: 
 	- The percentage of high school students who reported ever having sex has declined over a decade, from 47.8% in 2007 to 39.5% in 2017.
 	- Those who reported that they were currently sexually active, 61.5% in 2007 said they used a condom during their last sexual intercourse, compared with 53.8% in 2017.
 	- The percentage who reported injecting illegal drugs dropped from 2% in 2007 to 1.5% in 2017.
 	-About the same percentage of students, 19.9% versus 19%, reported being bullied at school in 2009 and in 2017, and 16.2% of students in 2011 reported being bullied online, compared with 14.9% in 2017.

 2018-present: P4C is developing a module to focus on youths smoking nicotine, which is where you come in! This site is being created to contact adolescents like yourself on when and how to meet to test out new features P4C is testing.
